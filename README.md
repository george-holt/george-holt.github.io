## Build Process

The website uses a custom Node.js build process that:

- **Minifies HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for optimal performance
- **Optimizes images** (converts to WebP format)
- **Removes unused CSS** using PurgeCSS
- **Generates build statistics** showing compression ratios
- **Watches for changes** and auto-rebuilds during development

### Build Output

- **Original size**: ~87KB
- **Build size**: ~56KB
- **Compression**: ~36% reduction

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Structure
- **CSS3** - Custom responsive design (no external frameworks)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Interactive functionality
- **Chart.js** - Interactive radar charts
- **PapaParse** - CSV data parsing
- **Node.js** - Build automation
- **GitHub Pages** - Hosting
- **GitHub Actions** - Automated deployment

## Deployment

The website is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions:

1. Push changes to the `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions runs the build process
3. Built files are deployed to `https://george-holt.github.io`

## Performance Optimizations

- **Minified assets** for faster loading
- **WebP images** for smaller file sizes
- **System fonts** to eliminate external font loading
- **Inline critical CSS** to prevent render blocking
- **Removed unused libraries** (jQuery, Bootstrap, IE polyfills)
- **PurgeCSS** to eliminate unused CSS rules

## Development Notes

- The site uses CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming
- All styles are inlined in HTML files for optimal performance
- Mobile-first responsive design with custom breakpoints
- No external CSS or JavaScript dependencies in production
